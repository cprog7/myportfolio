I am a historian working at the intersection of the humanities and computer science. 
My research interests center on computational methods and the epistemological implications of the digital. In my research, I reframe historical research questions with the means of computational and multi-methodological approaches, bridging quantitative, qualitative, digital, and computational methodologies, and critically reflect their application. I consider digital literacy and computational competencies, including statistics, data modeling, digital source criticism, and tool and algorithm criticism, as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship.

In my current project as [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/institute/people/petz) at [Leibniz Institute of European History](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/), I examine historical court records computationally on the extent of political judiciary, and the transformation of the former Austrian democracy to an autocracy (1934--38) in the field of digital legal history.

I am part of the editorial team at [Journal of Historical Network Research (JHNR)](https://jhnr.uni.lu/index.php/jhnr/about/editorialTeam)‚ and senior convenor of the [working group "Graphs and Networks"](https://dig-hum.de/ag-graphen-netzwerke>) of the [DHd](https://dig-hum.de/). As part of the Local Organizing and Program Committe, I organized the [GrapHNR Conference](https://graphentechnologien.hypotheses.org/tagungen/graphentechnologien-2023) in Mainz in July 18 -- 21, 2023. Currently, we are editing the conference proceedings. I am also part of the organizers of the [Barcelona Past Networks Summer School](https://www.pastnetworks.net/) in June 25 -- 29, 2024.
