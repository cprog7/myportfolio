I am a historian working at the intersection of the humanities and computer science. 
My research interests center on computational methods and the epistemological implications of the digital. In more general terms, in my research, I reframe historical research questions with the means of computational and multi-methodological approaches, bridging quantitative, qualitative, digital, and computational methodologies, and critically reflect their application. I consider digital literacy and computational competencies, including statistics, data modeling, digital source criticism, and tool and algorithm criticism, as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship.

In my current project as [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/institute/people/petz) at [Leibniz Institute of European History](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/), I examine historical court records computationally on the construction of political criminality, and the transformation of the former Austrian democracy to an autocracy (1933--38) in the field of digital legal history.

I am editor at [Journal of Historical Network Research (JHNR)](https://jhnr.uni.lu/index.php/jhnr/about/editorialTeam)‚ and senior convenor of the [working group "Graphs and Networks"](https://dig-hum.de/ag-graphen-netzwerke>) of the [DHd](https://dig-hum.de/), and part of the Interim Coordination Board of the ["HNR Community"](https://historicalnetworkresearch.org/) during its transitioning process. 
As part of the Local Organizing and Program Committe, I organized the [GrapHNR Conference in Mainz](https://graphentechnologien.hypotheses.org/tagungen/graphentechnologien-2023). In international cooperations, I co-organized the Session on "Networks and the Human Past" at [INSNA SUNBELT 2024 in Edinburgh](https://sunbelt2024.com/organised-sessions/), and the the [Barcelona Past Networks Summer School 2024](https://www.pastnetworks.net/), which is set to be repeated in June 2025.
