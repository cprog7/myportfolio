In my research, I reframe historical research questions with the means of computational and multi-methodological approaches, bridiging quantitative, qualitative, digital, and computational methodologies, and critically reflect their application. I consider digital literacy and computational competencies, including statistics, data modeling, digital source criticism, and tool and algorithm criticism, as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship.\n\nIn my current project as [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/institute/people/petz) at [Leibniz Institute of European History](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/), I examine historical court records computationally on the extend of political judiciary and the transformation from democracy to autocracy in the field of digital legal history.\n\nI am part of the editorial team at [Journal of Historical Network Research (JHNR)](https://jhnr.uni.lu/index.php/jhnr/about/editorialTeam)‚ and co-convenor at [AG \"Graphen und Netzwerke\"](https://dig-hum.de/ag-graphen-netzwerke>) of the [DHd](https://dig-hum.de/).
