Additionally, we introduced the pipeline Quarto and highlighted its use for publishing reproducible research.\n\n\nA beginner’s guide to historical network research\nWinter School at IEG, Winter 2022/23\nIn this (fully online) winter school (co-taught with Dr. Demival Vasques Filho), we provided a guide for graduate students and early career researchers interested in the study of social networks with a special focus on historical research questions. This four day course covered the fundamentals of network analysis methods and their underlying theories, the history of historical network research, and covered pitfals in and potentials of network research for the historical studies. We offered hands-on exercises in Python using Python::NetworkX in Jupyter Notebooks. The winter school was complemented by talks by Dr. Henrike Rudolph (GAU, GER) on research designs and Dr. Martin Grandjean (UNIL, SUI) on network visualization. Prof. Dr. David Zbíral (MUNI, CZ) elaborated in a public keynote on his work in the DISSINET project.\n\n\nNatural Language Processing\nSeminar at JGU, Winter 2022/23 and Winter 2023/24\nIn this advanced seminar (co-taught with Dr. Demival Vasques Filho), we covered the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) utilizing GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks. The course covered in hands-on exercises in text processing with base Python, identifying linguist patterns with Python::SpaCy including pattern matching, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling. In the course, we discussed how to reflect working with digital sources, and best practices in algorithmic criticism.\nIn Winter Semester 2023/24 I taught this course on my own."

    "text": "In my dissertation, I discussed how to “Combine Network Research and Computational Methods on Historical Research Questions and its Implications for the Digital Humanities”, reflecting on the genesis of the digital humanities (DH) and social and historical network research (SNR and HNR), the theorization and impact of DH, as well as the requirements of a multimodal literacy incorporating digital and computational competences, algorithm and tool criticism, and the changed epistemologies of working with the digital. There, I proposed modeling as the underlying epistemological framework. With the framework of modeling, my thesis reconceptualizesd computational methodologies for historical research questions and identified modeling as an inherent concept within the historical studies, i.e. the historical narrative as a best-fit model to explain the how and why of history and periodization as models of time-scales as a construct of analysis to sharpen focus, and the use of networks as epistemic tools. In my dissertation, I evaluated the limitations and implications of its epistemological and ontological changes based on two case studies: on the extent of political judiciary in the Austrian “Corporate State”, and on the structural analysis of influence networks of intellectuals.\nAn overview of my publications is recorded at  0000-0002-6178-7332."

Network structures of political judiciary in the Austrian Corporate State”, I conceptionalized court records as networks (compare to Figure 1), which allowed me to analyze them structurally. Goal of the analysis was to investigate the extent of political judiciary in the transformed system of the so-called “Corporate State” of Austria. I evaluated differences in the legal prosecution of the political opposition based on over 1800 court trials from 1935 processed at the Viennese provincial courts.\nEvery subsequent analysis I did in R and R-Studio at first, and then fully switched to Python, which allows object-based programming and version-control via Anaconda and GitHub.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: (In Petz and Pfeffer 2021, Fig. 1) The figure on the left shows a multimodal sample network of 88 court proceedings, featuring 201 defendants in 204 cases with verdicts, 55 judges and 27 prosecutors. An edge equals a conviction. On the right: Figure focusing on one defendant in a (randomly chosen) single case’s court trial interpreted as a network. Layout algorithm used: Fruchterman-Rheingold in R::igraph. \n\n\nCombining a formalized network methodology and a quantitative assessment of frequencies and distributions with a qualitative contextualization, I could show different practices of political judiciary at court and specialized strategies to prosecute the political opposition, resulting in a clear bias against left-wing groups and a relative leniency in the conviction of National Socialists based on the evolution of charges in the courts’ actions (compare to Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: (In Petz and Pfeffer 2021, Tab. 7) Networks of co-occurring offenses of members of left- and right-wing political groups.

An edge symbolizes collaboration in the same processes. A spectral cluster analysis revealed three clusters, as represented in node colors.\n\n\nFinally, in the paper I argue that the system of control over the judiciary and over the political opposition was already crumbling in the Austrian capital in 1935, even before the ’’Anschluss” to NS-Germany in 1938. For the full paper, follow this link.\n\n\nConstructing political criminality\nMy current project extends on my previous work, and examines the various constructions of political criminality at court during the so-called “Corporate State” (1933/34–1938). There, I study the transformation from democracy to autocracy. I am examining e.g., linguistic strategies towards Social Democratic, Communist, and National Socialist suspects in the statements of police, prosecutors, and judges within the court proceedings. Questions of political and political-confessional marginalisation and (acceptable) deviancy at court will be of particular interest.\nMethodologically, the project combines quantitative, computational, digital and qualitative methods in the sense of a multi-methodological embedded digital humanities framework. In this project, I am employing Optical Character recognition (OCR) as well as text and data mining methods (NLP and statistics) in Python in order to analyze court recrods from the years 1933–1938. The project thus contributes to the field of computational history. This work is currently under progress."

This allowed us to re-evaluate, which scholars were most influential based on their structural position, such as centralities and knowledge-brokerage roles (e.g., Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: (In Petz et al 2022, Fig. 4) Frequency distribution of scholars per Region–Era (left), per Era–Discipline (top), and per Region–Discipline (center).

The size of nodes represents the amount of memberships.\n\n\nIn “Tracking the Evolution of Communities in a Social Network of Intellectual Influences”, we aimed to identify schools of thought in these intellectual networks by detecting communities, and thus structurally analyzed and evaluated how these communities formed and developed in time, tracking their compositon and characterized the structural patterns of their dynamic evolution (e.g., Figure 5). We contextualized the changes in selected network structures in order to establish the merit of this method for a new perspective on the history of intellectuals, their influences, and their ideas (e.g., Figure 6).\n\n\n\nFigure 6: (In Petz et al 2022, Fig. 5) Medieval period influence networks of two sub-samples of scholars located in AR and EU, respectively."
